# Catch Of The Day

This Single Page Application, built in React is for a *hypothetical* fishmonger.

It allows authentication via OAuth (Facebook) to manage the inventory for a fish store, permitting addition, removal and editing of items.
A non-authenticated user can add or remove fish that they want to purchase.

The React state is synced via **Firebase**, and some data is stored in **localStorage** for persistance in session.

Code is written by Abid Hasan for initial commit, but CSS and images are from [Wes Bos](http://www.wesbos.com).

# To Do
App needs to be deployed on Heroku
