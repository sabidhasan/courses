## Cloud Concepts

### Introduction to Cloud Computing

Azure is used by 85% of F500 companies. AZ-900 covers the basics of what the cloud is, why it's useful and where MS offerings fit in.

About 10-15 years ago, each company had a bunch of servers, with each having customized hardware. Each server was highly under-utilized. Next, Docker came into being and allowed **virtualization**, reducing challenges and cost. Challenges:

- High upfront cost for servers
- Space needed to host on premises
- Electricity and utility costs
- Hardware maintenance needed

The cloud is built on **virtualization**. Today, **cloud computing** enables companies to consume a compute resource - virtual machine, storage or app - like a utility. The provider owns a data center and deals with upkeep, networking, and hardware. Cloud service benefits:

- **high availability** (hardware failure) 
- **disaster recovery** (flood, etc.) 
- **fault tolerance**
- **rapid elasticity**

**Cost**: services are billed on demand - allowing easy scaling for organizations and ability to handle varying demand. Upfront cost is reduced, and majority of cost is in **Operating Expenditures** (ongoing costs), rather than **Capital Expenses** (these expenses last the company a long time).

Example: an Azure virtual machine can be configured with the cost given. An **App Service Plan**, for example, allows auto-scaling services.

Azure data centers exist across the world (**60 data centers**).



### Types of Cloud Computing Services

There are three main types of cloud services. What differentiates these is how much you manage vs. how much cloud provider manages:

1. Software as a Service (**SaaS**) - provider handles everything - hardware, OS, data and apps. These all run via the web browser.
2. Platform as a Service (**PaaS**) - provider handles hardware and OS, but you handle data and apps
3. Infrastructure as a Service (**IaaS**) - provider handles hardware, but you handle OS, data and applications

SaaS - example Office365
PaaS - example Azure Logic Apps
IaaS - example Azure
