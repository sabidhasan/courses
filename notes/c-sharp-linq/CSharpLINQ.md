# Introduction

Goals of **LINQ** (**Language Integrated Query**) was to harmonize how data is queried. Previously, there was a different API for in-memory, databases and XML files.

Random notes:

- `Array.Sort` can sort an array, but for custom arbitrary objects, it requires a class that implements the `IComparer`  interface for comparing the objects.
- `System.IO` is the namespace containing file system related things
- String interpolation can be given left or right padding: `$"Some {someString, -20}"`

LINQ has two syntaxes - the query syntax and the object-style syntax, but both functionally do the same thing.
