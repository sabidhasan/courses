## Introduction

A **business object** refers to a class for solving a business problem (this is from **domain driven design**), or a blueprint for solving a business problem. An **entity** is a "thing" that is represented as a class in the program.

Eg: A customer is an **entity**, which is represented by the Customer **class**, and this class is instantiated as customer **objects**.



## Identifying Classes from Requirements

To transform business requirements (i.e. some words) into concrete classes, do the following:

1. Analyze the problem
2. Identify the **nouns**
3. Define the class members (properties)
