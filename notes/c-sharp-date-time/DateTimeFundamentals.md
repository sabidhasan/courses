# Date and Time Fundamentals

**Noda Time** is a date time library for C#.

The **DateTime** struct is the built in class for dealing with date and time, representing an instant in time (date and time). **This is for more or less time-zone naïve date times**



## Parsing DateTimes (Without Time Zones)

To parse from a string, there is `Parse` and `TryParse`. Parsing is overloaded with a few signatures - string alone or a string and a culture. Parsing uses **system settings** when no culture is provided.

The `CultureInfo` library includes localization information.

```c#
var k = DateTime.Parse("2/2/2021 11:11:11 PM");
var m = DateTime.ParseExact("2/2/2021 11:11:11 PM", "M/d/yyyy h:mm:ss tt");
var d = DateTime.Parse("2/2/2021 11:11:11 PM", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-GB"));
```

The DateTime object is time zone naïve. Do not use it if you are doing time zone conversions



To get the current date time for the computer, use `DateTime.Now`.

---

To convert DateTime to string, the `LongDateString` method can be used:

```C#
Console.WriteLine(d.ToLongDateString());
```

Alternatively, we can use `ToString` with a format string.



## Time Zones

To bring time zones into the picture, use the `System.TimeZoneInfo` class, which simply represents a time zone. Then, `TimeZoneInfo` has a static method `ConvertTime` to convert a DateTime object:

```C#
var now = DateTime.Now;
var tz = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Canada/Eastern");
var easternTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(now, tz)
```



## DateTime Offsets (Timezones)

The `DateTimeOffset` class is like the `DateTime` class, but it is **time zone-aware**, and provides a time zone offset for times based off of UTC. 

The `TimeSpan` class represents a **span of time**. Coupled with `ToOffset` on the `DateTimeOffset` class, we can convert a datetime from one time zone to another.

To convert a date time from one time zone to another:

```C#
var date = "2/5/2021 11:22:44 PM";
var dateTime = DateTimeOffset.ParseExact(date, "M/d/yyyy h:mm:ss tt", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
// Convert to +10 hours offset from UTC
var converted = dateTime.ToOffset(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));
```

To get the **current UTC time zone-aware time**, use `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`

Any time can be converted to local time by calling `ToLocalTime()` on it or to universal time by using `ToUniversalTime()`



# Date and Time Arithmetic

## Performing Arithmetic

You can add time directly to `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset` instances using methods such as `AddSeconds`.

Performing arithmetic (add or subtract) on `DateTime` objects yields `TimeSpan` objects. Arithmetic can be done using the built in methods - `.Add()` , `Subtract()`, ``Multiply()` and `Divide()` methods.

---

The `Calendar` class has static methods for getting calendar weeks out of date times.



## Extending a Date

If you have a date (like 2019-08-01T12:00:00) and want to extend by 5 months, you can use the `AddMonths` method:

```C#
var dt = new DateTimeOffset(2019, 8, 1, 12, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero);
var extended = dt.AddMonths(5);
```

The issue is that adding 4 months puts you at 2020-01-01T12:00:00. Typically, you want 23:59:59 on the previous day. For this, you can subtract a tick:

```C#
var extended = dt.AddMonths(5).AddTicks(-1);
// This is 2019-12-31T23:59:59
```



# Common Scenarios

## Overlapping Dates and Times

- To calculate relative time, `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` can be used, but comparison should be done in the same time zone (UTC)
- Dates can be subtracted by calling `AddDate` with a negative date
- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` can occur when working with leap years
- When working with SQL, `EntityFramework` contains support for `DateTimeOffset`. SQL Server also supports `DateTime` but that has no time zone details.



## Unix Timestamps

- **Unix Timestamp** is elapsed seconds since Jan 1, 1970 UTC
- `DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeSeconds()` method provides a DateTimeOffset instance from Unix timestamp
