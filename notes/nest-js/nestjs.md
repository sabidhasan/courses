## Intro

Install the NestJS CLI globally.

NestJS consists of the following pieces:

1. **Module** - grouping the rest of this list into a reusable part of the application
2. **Controller** - the code that handles incoming requests
3. **Service** - the code that communicates with the database
4. **Entity** - the model for the database
5. Repository



## Modules

A module hosts all components for a related feature.

Modules are singletons and meant to be reusable (and because they are **singletons**, they will only be created once by Nest). All apps have a **root module**, called `AppModule`. A module is a module because it is decorated by the `@Module` decorator.

To generate a new module

```bash
nest generate module <name>
```

Each module has four properties:

1. **Imports**: anything that needs to be injected that ISN'T decorated with `@Injectable` goes in here (Injectables go into Providers below). Example is TypeORM `Repository` class, which is not directly `@Injectable`.
2. **Exports**: providers that this module wishes to export
3. **Controllers**: the route handlers for this module
4. **Providers**: providers (possibly services but also other injectable providers) that this module will rely on. Services are special because they can be CLI-generated and are generally meant for business logic.



## Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling **requests**, and returning **response**s. A controller is bound to a specific path (and subpaths, such as `/tasks`), and has HTTP method handlers within for those paths.

Use the `@Controller` decorator with a path to mark a class a controller. Within a controller, methods are called **handlers** and they determine what HTTP verb they respond to - `@Get`, `@Post`, etc. To get the request body in a post decorator, use the `@Body` decorator.

To generate a new controller:

```bash
nest generate controller <name>
```



## Providers/Services

A provider is any class that can be injected into a constructor as a **singleton** (for example, in a controller) via **dependency injection**. Use the `@Injectable` decorator to mark a class a provider. They can be:

- simple value
- class
- factory
- services

A **service** is a provider, but not all providers are services. A service is the main source of **business logic** - for saving/reading data, DB interactions, validating data, etc. Services are singletons.

To inject the provider/service into a controller, define it in its constructor, if it exists in this controller's module's providers array:

```typescript
@Controller('/tasks')
export class TasksController {
	constructor(private tasksServiceInstance: TaskService) {}
}
```

To create a service using the Nest CLI:

```basj
nest generate service <name>
```



## Models

A model is a simple non-database way that data is expected to be on a server. Models can be defined in two ways, and in either case, they are POJOs:

1. Classes
2. Interfaces

An interface is easier/simpler to define, but it is lost after compilation. To define something as a model, nothing special is needed; rather, the model is there to help in typing things coming from the DB.

For persistent data, we use **entities** and **repositories** to interact with the database.



## Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

Data transfer objects (note they are not mandatory but helpful) make it easy to group data coming into the API from the outside, so that the shape of the data coming in is defined in one place and data validation can be easily done. Definition:

> A data transfer object is an object that encapsulates data and sends it between different subsystems of software.

DTOs represent the shape of data for a specific case so they **are not models** - e.g. when creating a task, we have a Create-Task-DTO, but the task model may have many more fields than the DTO.

DTOs can be defined via two ways, but same as models, it is recommended to define them as classes:

1. Classes
2. Interfaces

To use the DTO, extract it in controller methods with Body decorator. The body will be parsed into the shape of the DTO:

```typescript
@Post
createTask(@Body() createTaskDto: CreateTaskDto) {
  // do something
}
```



## Parameters

### URL Parameters

To grab parameters in a controller, use the `@Param` decorator, along with providing a colon based name. If passed no arguments, it returns all parsed parameters in an object. Otherwise, pass it a string to get a specific named parameter:

```typescript
@Get('/:id')
getTaskById(@Param('id') myId: string) {
	// do something
}
```

### Query Parameters

To grab query parameters, use the `@Query` parameter. This can extract one or more query parameters from the URL based on a provided DTO.

## Pipes

**Pipes** handle a request before it is passed to a handler in the controller. They perform:

- *Data transformation* (transform JSON data into an instantiated class)
- *Data validation* (reject the request if it is not valid)



Pipes can throw errors, return data, modify incoming data, etc. all before the request is passed to the handler. Some common pipes built-in to NestJS:

- **ValidationPipe**: validate incoming DTO for missing/extra fields and types
- **ParseIntPipe**: since everything coming is a string, it can parse them into numbers

In addition, **custom pipes** can be made. These are classes decorated with `@Injectable`, and implement the `PipeTransform` interface. This means it has a transform method:

```typescript
transform(value, metadata) { }
```

To use a pipe, there are several ways:

1. Before a controller's handler, by the `UsePipes` decorator, to handle all requests to that handler. This is preferred.

2. For a specific parameter in one handler for a controller:

   ```typescript
   @Post
   createTask(
   	@Body(SomeCoolPipe) createTaskDto: CreateTaskDto
   ) {}
   ```

   

3. Global app-level pipes used for all requests configured when starting app instance

To validate data, the built in `ValidationPipe` can be used at the route handler level, along with installing `class-validator` and `class-transform` packages.



## Object Relational Mapping - Entities and Repositories

TypeORM is the preferred ORM for NestJS, due to its strong Typescript support. NestJS TypeORM module must be installed for working with TypeORM. There are two classes for ORM:

- An **entity**, which is a class decorated by `@Entity()` from type-orm and extends `BaseEntity` represents the entity in the database

- A **repository** is a class decorated by `EntityRepository` and extends `Repository` is a helper class for doing actual DB operations with an entity, and is called from a Service method

Repository can be injected into the service via dependency injection, and added as an import in the module.

The separation of concerns is:

- **Controller** - handles requests and calls service methods
- **Service** - orchestrates logic for dealing with DB operations, throws exceptions, handles high level business logic, etc. and calls the repository methods
- **Repository** - represents the core CRUD database operations (has access to querybuilder, etc. as it extends the `Repository` class)



## Authentication

JWT tokens contain header, a payload (which should not contain sensitive information) and signature created from the payload+header+secret. On authentication, verify that the payload+header that are incoming combined with secret produce the same signature as the incoming JWT.

`UseGuard` decorator from nestjs allows guarding a controller or method. The `PassportModule` is passportJS wrapper for Nest, and a custom JwtStrategy class can be injected as a provider into any other class.



## Logging

NestJS ships with a logger supporting different levels: verbose, debug, log, warning, error. 



## Testing

NestJS uses Jest for testing. In addition, there are testing helpers that create mock modules with mocked dependencies.
